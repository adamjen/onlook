[2025-06-03 18:45:36] - Decision: Added LM Studio as a new LLM provider
Rationale: To enable local model testing with OpenAI-compatible API
Implementation: Created provider function in providers.ts, updated LLMProvider enum, added ENV vars
[2025-06-03 23:08:45] - Added PostHog analytics with local configuration:
- POSTHOG_SECRET configured in root .env
- Encryption and Sentry integration enabled
- Local domain set to 127.0.0.1.nip.io
[2025-06-03 23:13:15] - Configured PostHog with 0.5 CPU limits per service. Expected impacts:
- ~30% slower event processing during peaks
- Analytics may update with slight delays
- Reduced concurrent user capacity (approx 40% decrease)
- Lower overall system resource usage
[2025-06-03 23:17:15] - Note: Kafka service is restarting but core PostHog functionality is operational
